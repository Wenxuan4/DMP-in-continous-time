# DMP-in-continous-time
The pdf file names "DMP model.pdf" provides the summary of the theoretical models and numerical methods;
The code file named "DMP.mlx" provides the main code to obtain the analytical and numerical results, 
and the functions used for different models are in the folders.

The code for "01_baseline" model is complete, but the code and writing work for "02_endo_destr" model is in progress, and will be updated once the work is finished.

The function code for "sparse grid" is provided by Andreas Shaab. For additional details, please see https://github.com/schaab-lab/SparseEcon.
